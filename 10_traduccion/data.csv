Utilizing a 4-step charging program (initialization, bulk charge, absorption mode and float mode), it allows users to simply connect the charger to up to four batteries, either in or out of a vehicle and forget about it until you are ready to use it, with the confidence that the batteries in all four vehicles are being maintained at optimal performance levels. This makes it perfect for seasonal and recreational vehicles like motorcycles, jet skis, ATV's, snowmobiles and more,. It is also safe for your battery because it utilizes advanced microprocessor technology that automatically switches its output voltage to a storage or float level. This feature eliminates the need to worry about the damaging effects of overcharging, and the resulting need to check on the condition of a charging battery. If or when the battery voltage drops too far under load, this same smart technology resumes output power and the charging cycle begins again.
